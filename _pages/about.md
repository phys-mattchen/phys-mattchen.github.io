Welcome! I am Bo-Yu Chen (陳柏諭), a first-year undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/Default.html" target="_blank">Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>. I also go by the name Matt. I am conducting my undergraduate research with <a href="https://northwestern.jerryhu.page/home" target="_blank">Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html" target="_blank">Han Liu</a> at <a href="http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank">MAGICS</a> lab in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. Prior to my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://cyellab453.wixsite.com/mysite/about-us" target="_blank">Chiashain Chuang</a>, <a href="https://el.cycu.edu.tw/en/portfolio-item/dung-sheng-tsai/" target="_blank">Dung-Sheng Tsai</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/buzznote/p2?authuser=0" target="_blank">Po-Han Lee</a> as my research advisors in the field of condensed matter physics.

## Research Interest:
My primary research interests revolve around modern artificial intelligence and quantum electronic materials. My aim is to revolutionize the foundations of state-of-the-art information technology. Equipped with tools from statistical learning theory and the computational theory of the Ising model, I am dedicated to making fundamental contributions to data science and machine learning. The success of this research has the potential to enhance the performance of emerging Large Language Models.

In terms of applied research, I am interested in investigating magnetic sensors for data storage devices. I employ nickel-catalyzed atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) to synthesize low-defect, highly uniform, and extensively covered transfer-free graphene. The goal of this research is to make 2D nanomaterial-based magnetic sensors with air stability commercially viable in the future.

## Topics I am currently working on (Statistical Machine Learning):
* Computational and Statistical Theory of Ising Model in Machine Learning
* Sparse Modern Hopfield Models and Non-parametric Modern Hopfield Models
* Sparse Tandem Hopfield Model for Multi-Resolution Time Series Prediction

## Topics I am currently working on (Materials Science):
* Air-stable, Defectless and Magnetoresistance Properties in Nickel-catalyzed Transfer-free Graphene
* Modulation of Quantum Electronic Material Transport via Vacuum Annealing
* Temperature-Dependent Magnetoresistance of Graphene

## Topics I had worked on in the past (First Principle Calculation):
* Ab Initio Study on the Growth Mechanism of Graphene on Metal
* Layer-dependent Properties of $SnSe_2$ Two Dimensional Materials
* First-Principles Study on Half-Metallic Ferrimagnetism in Pb-based Double Perovskites
