Welcome! My name is Bo-Yu Chen (pronounced with the emphasis on the first syllable 'Bo', 陳柏諭), a first-year undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/Default.html" target="_blank">Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a> (Start in 2023 fall). I also go by the name Matt.

## Research Interest:
My primary research center around modern artificial intellegence and quantum electronic materials and aim to revolutionarize the foundation of state-of-the-art information technology. With the tools in statistical learning theory and computational theory of Ising model, I seek to make contributions to data science and machine learning at a fundamental level. Success on this research has potential to enhance the performance of emerging Large Language Models. 

My applied research interest is to investigate magnetic sensors for data storage devices. I utilize nickel-catalyzed atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) to synthesize low defects, high uniformity, and high coverage transfer-free graphene. The goal of this research topic is to make 2D nanomaterial-based magnetic sensors with air stability commercially viable in the future.

## Topics I am currently working on (Statistical Machine Learning):
* Computational and Statistical Theory of Ising Model in ML
* Large Language Models and Foundation Models

## Topics I am currently working on (Materials Science):
* Air-stable, defectless and magnetoresistance properties in nickel-catalyzed transfer-free graphene
* Modulation of quantum electronic material transport via vacuum annealing
* Temperature-Dependent Magnetoresistance of Graphene

## Topics I had worked on in the past (Computational Materials Science):
* Ab initio study on the growth mechanism of graphene on metal
* Layer-dependent properties of $SnSe_2$ two dimensional materials
* First-Principles Study on Half-Metallic Ferrimagnetism in Pb-based Double Perovskites
