Welcome! I am Bo-Yu Chen (陳柏諭), a first-year undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/Default.html" target="_blank">Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>. I also go by the name Matt. I am conducting my undergraduate research with <a href="https://northwestern.jerryhu.page/home" target="_blank">Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html" target="_blank">Han Liu</a> at <a href="http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank">MAGICS</a> lab in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. Prior to my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://cyellab453.wixsite.com/mysite/about-us" target="_blank">Chiashain Chuang</a>, <a href="https://el.cycu.edu.tw/en/portfolio-item/dung-sheng-tsai/" target="_blank">Dung-Sheng Tsai</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/buzznote/p2?authuser=0" target="_blank">Po-Han Lee</a> as my research advisors in the field of condensed matter physics.

## Topics I am currently working on (Statistical Machine Learning):
* Computational and Statistical Theory of Ising Model in Machine Learning
* <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12673" target="_blank">Sparse Modern Hopfield Models</a>

## Topics I had worked on in the past (Materials Science):
* Synthesis of transfer-free graphene by atmospheric-pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD)
* Modulation of Quantum Electronic Material Transport via Vacuum Annealing
* Temperature-Dependent Magnetoresistance of Graphene

## Topics I had worked on in the past (First Principle Calculation):
* Ab Initio Study on the Growth Mechanism of Graphene on Metal
* Layer-dependent Properties of $SnSe_2$ Two Dimensional Materials
* First-Principles Study on Half-Metallic Ferrimagnetism in Pb-based Double Perovskites
