Welcome! I am Bo-Yu Chen (陳柏諭), a first-year undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/Default.html" target="_blank">Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>. I also go by the name Matt. I am a research assistant under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html" target="_blank">Han Liu</a> at <a href="http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank">MAGICS</a> lab in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/" target="_blank">department of computer science</a>, <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. Prior to my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to have Prof. <a href="https://cyellab453.wixsite.com/mysite/about-us" target="_blank">Chiashain Chuang</a>, <a href="https://el.cycu.edu.tw/en/portfolio-item/dung-sheng-tsai/" target="_blank">Dung-Sheng Tsai</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/buzznote/p2?authuser=0" target="_blank">Po-Han Lee</a> as my research advisors in the field of condensed matter physics.

## Research Interest:
My primary research center around modern artificial intellegence and quantum electronic materials and aim to revolutionarize the foundation of state-of-the-art information technology. With the tools in statistical learning theory and computational theory of Ising model, I seek to make contributions to data science and machine learning at a fundamental level. Success on this research has potential to enhance the performance of emerging Large Language Models. 

My applied research interest is to investigate magnetic sensors for data storage devices. I utilize nickel-catalyzed atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) to synthesize low defects, high uniformity, and high coverage transfer-free graphene. The goal of this research topic is to make 2D nanomaterial-based magnetic sensors with air stability commercially viable in the future.

## Topics I am currently working on (Statistical Machine Learning):
* Computational and Statistical Theory of Ising Model in Machine Learning
* Sparse Modern Hopfield Models and Non-parametric Modern Hopfield Models
* Sparse Tandem Hopfield Model for Multi-Resolution Time Series Prediction

## Topics I am currently working on (Materials Science):
* Air-stable, Defectless and Magnetoresistance Properties in Nickel-catalyzed Transfer-free Graphene
* Modulation of Quantum Electronic Material Transport via Vacuum Annealing
* Temperature-Dependent Magnetoresistance of Graphene

## Topics I had worked on in the past (First Principle Calculation):
* Ab Initio Study on the Growth Mechanism of Graphene on Metal
* Layer-dependent Properties of $SnSe_2$ Two Dimensional Materials
* First-Principles Study on Half-Metallic Ferrimagnetism in Pb-based Double Perovskites
