I am Bo-Yu Chen (陳柏諭), a first-year undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/Default.html" target="_blank">Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/" target="_blank">National Taiwan University</a>. I also go by the name Matt. I am conducting my undergraduate research with <a href="https://northwestern.jerryhu.page/home" target="_blank">Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html" target="_blank">Han Liu</a> at <a href="http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html" target="_blank">MAGICS</a> lab in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>. Prior to my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://cyellab453.wixsite.com/mysite/about-us" target="_blank">Chiashain Chuang</a>, <a href="https://el.cycu.edu.tw/en/portfolio-item/dung-sheng-tsai/" target="_blank">Dung-Sheng Tsai</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/buzznote/p2?authuser=0" target="_blank">Po-Han Lee</a> as my research advisors in the field of condensed matter physics.
